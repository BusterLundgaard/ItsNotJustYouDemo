# It's Not Just You.

For the first time in 5 years, two women meet again, at a busstop, both on the way to a class-reunion. It's not just you, though: Something is wrong. These two just can't seem to have a normal conversation. 

This is a short (~20 min) text-based interactive fiction experience. You play as both charachters!
